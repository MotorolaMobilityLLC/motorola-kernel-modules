Motorola Mobility. Battery Manager ULOG Specific Bindings

Why we need adsp battery manager log support in AP side?
1. Only diag_mdlog in bug2go can help to collect ADSP battery manager log.
2. ADSP battery manager mdlog is not enabled by default in Bug2Go configuration
   and we have to enable it manually.
3. Diag mdlog has to be pulled out from phone and use QXDM tool to parse the log
   even if the ADSP battery manger log is enabled in diag log configuration of bug2go.
4. Factory and user version will never use Bug2Go, so diag_mdlog may not be available.

What the new DLKM bm_adsp_ulog.ko benefits us?
1. Provide debugfs interface to collect battery manager ADSP log in AP side.
2. Provide debugfs interfaces to configure log level and category for log mask.
3. Provide exported APIs for other Moto battery charger DLKM to get battery charger
   ADSP log and output to Kernel log or IPC logging.
